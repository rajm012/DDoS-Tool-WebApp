## Attack Types üí•

| Attack Type          | Description                                                                 | Input Values                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UDP Flood**        | Floods the target with UDP packets.                                         | Target IPs, Target Port, Duration, Intensity, Packet Size                   |
| **SYN Flood**        | Overwhelms the target with SYN requests.                                    | Target IPs, Target Port, Duration, Intensity                                |
| **HTTP Flood**       | Floods the target with HTTP requests.                                       | Target IPs, Target Port, Duration, Intensity, Custom Headers                |
| **ICMP Flood**       | Floods the target with ICMP (ping) packets.                                 | Target IPs, Duration, Intensity                                             |
| **Slowloris**        | Sends partial HTTP requests to exhaust the target's resources.              | Target IPs, Target Port, Duration, Intensity                                |
| **DNS Amplification**| Exploits DNS servers to flood the target with amplified traffic.            | Target IPs, Duration, Intensity                                             |

## Testing and Monitoring üîç

### Tools for Testing
- **Wireshark**: Monitor network traffic and analyze packets.
- **Terminal**: View real-time logs and output directly in the terminal.
- **Logs Page**: Access detailed attack logs and statistics on the web interface.

### Example Commands
- Monitor UDP traffic with Wireshark:
  ```bash
  wireshark -k -i <interface> -f "udp"
  ```
- Check ICMP traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i <interface> icmp
  ```

## Server Config üåé

For every tool we can make our own server and i used two of the prominent methods:

1. Using inbuilt flask server as:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Using the python script to make one server
   
   See the folder Servers where i have designed Snippet to get the various servers for testing. You can run that too to make a server on port 8000 and test it accoordingly.
